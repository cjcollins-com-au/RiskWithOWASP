# Risk Register with OWASP Risk Scoring

Opinions vary on the usage of the OWASP risk scoring, but I noted the inclusion in CISO Assistant (and it seems to have been a requested feature there) so though it might be useful to put an Excel version together.

The great thing about this is that it provides a structured method of scoring, based on a set of 16 criteria and simply applying an average to the scores.

(Though the final score is taken this way too, which varies from the typical approach of multipling the likeiihood and impact values).

It can also be customised.  For example:
* Some people think the Skill rating list should be the other way around.
* For privacy violation, maybe your organisation doesn't have millions of customers and wants to set these values more appropriately.
* I've changed the formula for business impact so that a financial rating of 9 (bankruptcy) will always take precedence.
* You could exclude certain values, add others, change descriptions to suit your organisation.

An advantage to this approach is that it helps take some of the guesswork and perhaps some bias out of the process.  

For example, an asset owner might regard impact on their own assets as '9' (and perhaps other asset owners disagree) but with the OWASP approach everything is worked through with respect to the organisation.  This helps remove that bias and helps everyone understand where the assets site
